🚀 Todo App Backend – MERN Stack
Welcome to the backend service of the ✨Todo App✨ — the engine behind your tasks! This server handles all the data — creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting your todos — while keeping everything organized and connected to a database.

🧠 What This Project Does
This backend:

📝 Stores your todos in a database

📬 Listens for requests from your frontend (like a React app)

🛠️ Handles logic to create, update, delete, or get todos

🔁 Sends back clean, structured responses (usually in JSON)

📚 Uses a MongoDB database to store everything permanently


🧱 Tech Stack
Node.js – Runs the server-side JavaScript code

Express.js – Handles routing, requests, and responses with ease

MongoDB – Stores your todo data in a flexible NoSQL format

Mongoose – Provides schema and model support for working with MongoDB

dotenv – Loads environment variables securely from a .env file

cors – Enables communication between frontend and backend on different ports

nodemon – Restarts the server automatically during development on file changes
